Movie Genre Classification using Machine Learning
In this machine learning project, we aim to predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary using various natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms. We will leverage techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines (SVM) to build an accurate genre classification model.
